Keepr is a social network that allows users to visually share and discover new interests by posting images or videos to their own, or others', collections (i.e., a collection of 'vaults,' usually with a common theme) and browsing what other users have kept.

### New Skills
Keepr was the most complex app I had created to date. I learned to make a plan and document my work as I go in order to make sure I kept things consistent and didn't miss any connections.

### Create Posts
Add and sort images (keeps) to share with anyone visiting the Keepr site or your profile.

### Keepr Community
Browse others’ posts and add them to your vaults. Posts retain a count of how many times they’ve been viewed, and how many times they’ve been added to a vault.
